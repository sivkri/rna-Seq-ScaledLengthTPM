# Calculate lengthscaledTPM from salmon output files

# RNA-Seq Data Analysis using ScaledLengthTPM.R

This repository contains the code "ScaledLengthTPM.R" for performing RNA-Seq data analysis, specifically calculating length-scaled transcripts per million (TPM) values using the Salmon tool and the GenomicFeatures package in R.

## Prerequisites

Before using the code, ensure that you have the following:

- R programming language installed (version 3.5 or higher)
- Required R packages installed: readr, tidyr, tximport, GenomicFeatures

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the "ScaledLengthTPM.R" file to your local machine.

2. Set the working directory:
```R
setwd("path/to/your/directory")
```
Replace "path/to/your/directory" with the appropriate path to the directory containing your RNA-Seq data and the "transcriptome.gtf" file.

3. Install the required R packages:
```R
install.packages(c("readr", "tidyr", "tximport", "GenomicFeatures"))
```

4. Prepare your data:
   - Place your RNA-Seq data files in the "siva_SALMON_OUT/WT" directory.
   - Ensure that the quantification files generated by Salmon have the extension "quant.sf" and are located in the appropriate directories.

5. Modify the code if necessary:
   - If your "transcriptome.gtf" file is named differently or located in a different directory, update the "gtf_file" variable in the code.
   - Adjust any other relevant paths or parameters according to your data and analysis requirements.

6. Execute the code:
```R
source("ScaledLengthTPM.R")
```
This will run the code and perform the RNA-Seq data analysis, generating the required outputs.

7. Review the outputs:
   - The code will generate two CSV files: "tx2gene-WT.csv" and "txi_lengthscaledTPM_WT.csv".
   - "tx2gene-WT.csv" contains the mapping of transcript IDs to gene IDs.
   - "txi_lengthscaledTPM_WT.csv" contains the calculated length-scaled TPM values for each transcript.

8. Interpret the results and use them for downstream analysis or visualization as needed.

## Additional Information

- The code assumes that the necessary files (RNA-Seq data, "transcriptome.gtf") are correctly organized in the provided directories. Double-check the paths and file names to ensure they match your setup.
